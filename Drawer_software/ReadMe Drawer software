Worskspace Setup

Step 1)
Download and install Arduino Ide on this website:
https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
Keep all the default options during the installation.

Step 2)
On arduino IDE, on File-> preferences. When the Preferences window appears, copy and paste following link to the 
Additional Boards Manager URLs textbox. (This step may take about 20 min.)

Step 3)
Click Tools → Board → Boards Manager.

After the installation, “INSTALLED” will be appeared.
See if OpenCR Board is now on the list of Tools → Board. Click this to import the OpenCR Board source

Step 4)
To see if the installation worked, plug your OpenCr card via an USB port, it should appears in Tools → Port → COMX where X is the
number of the usb port (1,2,3...)
You can also test the exemples in FILE → EXEMPLES → OpenCr → "any exemple code"

Your workspace should be fine. If not refers to this documentation:
