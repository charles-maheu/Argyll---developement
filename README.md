# Argyll - development
Open source semester projet from a team of student from University of Sherbrooke in robotic engineering. ðŸ¤–

## The project
The main goal is to **improve a 6 joints robotic arm** by adding new features. The project offers an **automatic drawer** opening and closing solution, as well as a **special gripper** with a small device to grab ice cubes from a glass. All of these features are controlled by a **complete interface on an android app** which communicates through Bluetooth. The project uses a RaspberryPi as a communication bridge and a database for different settings. Controlled motors include servos and DC motors and they are controlled from an arduino or from an openCR card.

## The motivation
The project aims to help with the autonomy of a disable client who lives inside of his bedroom. This client has muscular dystrophy and uses his previously completely homemade robotic arm to achieve different functions like drinking water with a sponge or eating small ice cubes. The special gripper can help him accomplish the latter and can grab common object with slightly more ease. He operates everything from his phone, hence the project integrating a control interface. This interface with large buttons occupies only the bottom part of the screen to allow for easier control for him. The drawer opening mechanism can be controlled from the app in various scenarios to enable the robot to access the content within.

## The instructions
The project contains different parts and various steps must be taken to get a functionnal product. For the robotic arm itself and other related features, you can visit [this related Git repository (RobotAide - projetS4)](https://github.com/JeremieBourque1/projetS4) from an other team of students. All the different steps are detailed in this git's wiki and more technical informations are available in related folders.
