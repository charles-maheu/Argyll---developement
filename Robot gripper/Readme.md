# Argyll - Robot Gripper with rotational wrist
This document contains all files and instructions necessary to reproduce the physical assemply of the robot gripper

## 1. Summary

   This is a linear gripper made for picking small to medium light objects. It works on its own but is most useful at the end of a robotic arm on a standard 90 degrees bracket.
   This gripper is composed of too main structures: the wrist and the gripper.

## 2. Functionalities

   - Full 360 degrees range of rotational motion
   - Ice cube picker upper
   - Maximum 55mm of grip width
   - Fist person view camera support


## 3. Parts you will need

_A more elaborate list can be found in the assembly.pdf document_

- 4x 6-32 Thread, 5/8" Long screws
- 4x 6-32 Thread nuts
- 4x 2-56 Thread, 5/8" Long screws
- 4x 2-56 Thread nuts
- HS-788HB Servo
- HS-40 Servo
- HS-5055MG Servo
- Coupler (1/4")
- 90° Pattern Mount

*The exact parts and material used are mentioned in the assembly instructions document, replacements can be made but I cannot guarantee that it will work*

## 4. SolidWorks setup

The pieces were made in SolidWorks 2019, you must have this version or more recent for the .SLDASM and .SLDPRT files to be compatible.

Before opening the CAD assembly in SolidWorks, you must change some settings so that SolidWorks does not open 
the default rack and pinion parts. To do so, uncheck the box "Make this folder the default search location for 
Toolbox components" in the *Hole Wizard/Toolbox* section of the settings. 
For more help, see ([ref.](https://forum.solidworks.com/thread/78786)).

## 5. Help

The SolidWorks assembly is in the CAD folder in this github repository if the assembly instructions are not clear enough
